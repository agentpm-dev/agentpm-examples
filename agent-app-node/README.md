## Node Agent

### SDK and CLI prerequisites

Use AgentPM SDK **0.1.17 or newer** and install AgentPM CLI **0.1.43 or newer**
on PATH (or set `AGENTPM` to its executable). Every SDK Tool call delegates to
the CLI, including legacy Python and Node Tools. Install the CLI in container
images and CI jobs that run this app.

### What it does

A **LangChain (Node)** agent that loads tools from AgentPM and orchestrates a “research assistant” flow:

1. Scrape Wikipedia
2. Summarize (OpenAI)
3. Translate (OpenAI)
4. Sentiment
5. Resize first image

### Key differences vs Python agent

- Uses **OpenAI Tools Agent** (function calling) + **StructuredTool** wrappers.
- Tool **schemas are dynamic**: converts each tool’s `meta.inputs` (JSON Schema) → **Zod** at runtime so the LLM always emits valid JSON args.

### AgentPM & tools

- `"kind": "agent"`
- Tools are **installed via AgentPM** and loaded dynamically in code (see `agent.json` and `src/main.ts`).
- Tools are loaded and run via the Node SDK `"@agentpm/sdk": "^0.1.17"`

Example install:

```bash
agentpm install @zack/wikipedia-scrape@0.1.1
agentpm install @zack/summarize-text@0.1.3
agentpm install @zack/translate-text@0.1.0
agentpm install @zack/sentiment-analysis@0.1.1
agentpm install @zack/resize-image@0.1.4
```

or

```bash
# tools already defined in agent.json
agentpm install
```

### Quirks

- Requires `@langchain/core@^0.2`, `langchain@^0.2`, `@langchain/openai@^0.3`, and `zod`.
- Tool calls use `agentpm run --machine`; the CLI owns subprocess execution,
  JSON output handling and timeouts.

### Setup & run

```bash
pnpm --dir agent-app-node install

pnpm -w add langchain@^0.2 @langchain/core@^0.2 @langchain/openai@^0.3 -F agent-app-node

pnpm --dir agent-app-node add -D dotenv-cli

# load env inline and run
pnpm --dir agent-app-node exec dotenv -e .env.local -- pnpm  dev
```
